## HEADER 

---
### 1.HEADER LOCATION IN TFS
Header location is in Source Branch :

D:\TFS_GlobalV5\Assetraking\AssetTrackMVC_MySQL_for_Global_Version_5.2-QA\Souces\AssetTrak.Server\AssetrakWebServer\Arhata.Assetrak.Service.Host.\headers.txt

### 2.HOW DEVELOPER WILL UPDATE HEADERS
Developers add the headers in header files and they mention in JIRA point and check in into the DEVELOPER branch.

### 3.HOW SHALL WE MAINTAIN CUSTOMER SPECIFIC HEADERS
We need to discuss with Developers & Devops Seniors.

### 4.HOW HEADERS WILL BE MIGRATED
Devops see the header files in point and merged into a target branch in TFS.

Then he picks the Header File in a Target branch and Validates it on  JSON Validator online. 

After Validating header devops goto target branch url and take a backup of previous header file and replace the new Header with Old header.

## Code Merging

---

*** Open Jira (https://arhata.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/10102) then go to the dashboard and go to DevOps merging Interface.

*** Then select Point and Note down the ID of Change Set in notepad++ for our reference.

*** Go to Azure DevOps(https://dev.azure.com/shaileshs0980/_git/AssetCues/branches) then go to Source branch & go to History.

*** Then Open the point after selecting 3 dot Options then Select Cherry-Pick.

*** Then Select Target Branch then Create Cherry-Pick.

*** Itâ€™s Create Temporary Branch to merge the Changes.

*** Then if you Have Description then add it Otherwise Create it.

*** Then add a Comment(by Rushikesh-Point description).

***  Then complete it and select all the 3 Options Strictly then Complete Merge.

*** Then go to Target Branch to See the Merged Changes.

### SERVICE SIDE

*** Open Visual Studio & Open Source Branch OR open
D:\TFS_GlobalV5\Assetraking\AssetTrackMVC_MySQL_for_Global_Version_5.2DEV\Souces\AssetTrak.Server\AssetrakWebServer\AssetrakWebServer.sln

*** Get latest of Source Branch Then clean & Build.(DEV)

*** Close the Source Branch & Open Target Branch OR open D:\TFS_GlobalV5\Assetraking\AssetTrackMVC_MySQL_for_Global_Version_5.2-QA\Souces\AssetTrak.Server\AssetrakWebServer\ AssetrakWebServer.sln


*** Get the latest of Target Branch Then clean & Build.(QA)

*** Select Source Branch then right click then go to Branching & Merging.

*** Check & Select Source and target Branch Properly. Also select Option Selected Change sets Strictly.

*** Then next, the change sets list appears.Do not select multiple change sets, select one by one and copy the name of the change set in Notepad++. Then next.

*** If there is conflict then it displays 2 split windows including source & target (Call Developer).

*** If there is no conflict then merge the change set and next.

*** Then go to Team Explorer and go to Pending Changes.then go to all show solution changes and Include [merge,edit] files to target branch.

*** After checking all files write a comment by Rushi: Point Description.

*** Then Click Check-in when Check in successfully done then take Get latest version and clean & build the target branch .

### HANDLING CONFLICTS

*** If there is Conflict Occurs During Merging then we call the respective Developer of that point.

*** Then he will merge the changes in merge tools and take the respective changes of that point and then devops will  merge the changes.

### MERGING HEADER FILES

*** Developer will check the header files in the Point number in JIRA.

*** Then devops will merge the header files by taking the point number and get the latest of the source branch then clean & build.

*** Then get the latest of the target branch then Clean & build.

*** Then open target branch and go to branching & merging tab then go to merging then select the source & target branch and Stickly Select the Selected Changesets.

*** Then go to the respective point and then next & finish.If there is conflict then it displays 2 split windows including source & target (Call Developer).

*** If there is no conflict then go to Team Explorer and go to Pending Changes.then go to all show solution changes and Include [merge,edit] header files to target branch.

### 1.Which Branch to pick?
* Upload to any URL goes from PRODUCTION branch
* Only for our internal URL, 
qa.assetrak.net >> QA branch
uat.assetrak.net >> UAT branch     
Preproduction.assetrak.net >> PRD latest branch
* There are multiple versions of PRD branch eg.5.3.0, 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.3, 5.3.4
* To new hosting / new client upload goes from latest version for now PRD_5.3.4
* For updating older clients, we migrate DB to latest branch and upload from latest branch

### 2.Which DB to pick?
* To upgrade a client we need to backup the original DB associated with the URL and then upgrade the DB with queries required for upgradation.
* To a new client, we need to select the same blank DB as that of the code version.

### 3.Scripts to be run?
* If there are any query files in branch folder >> DB changes 

### 4.How to upgrade customer instance?
* Client side code upgrade
* Service side code upgrade
* DB upgrade
* Header and resource of latest version

### 5. Maintain history of new customer instances and upgrades?
We are maintaining upload in file :
